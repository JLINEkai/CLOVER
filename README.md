# Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis (CLOVER)


We propose a cost-effective learning scheme for accurate pathology vision and language inference named as CLOVER. To achieve fast domain tuning with low training resources, we adopt the BLIP-2 architecture as a visual language pre-training. We leverage the paired pathological image and text captures dataset to align the vision and language. For the instruction fine-tuning, we meticulously design prompts tailored for pathological question answering and use GPT-3.5 for generating effective instruction dataset at low cost, referred as the "generation-based instructions". The instructions generated by our PVLM-orient prompt show strong capabilities in the model tuning. Additionally, we construct instructions by matching template questions with the original text captions to enhance the model's vision understanding ability, referred as the "template-based instructions". The integration of these two types of instructions gives rise to hybrid-form instructions, which significantly enhance CLOVER's conversational abilities in the field of pathology.









## Release
- Model and instruction dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

  *We have created a grounded image-text dataset from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. The bottom row displays an illustrative example. First, we detect frames that have a stable background. Then we extract the narrators' mouse cursors. Then, we perform spatio-temporal clustering on the mouse pointer locations to obtain dense visual groundings for the narrators' speech. Using this method, we create grounded image-text dataset, from which we generate Quilt-Instruct to train our visual Language Learning Model, Quilt-LLaVA.*
